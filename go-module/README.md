# go module

This module is using the 'math' packge to create basic logic we will use in the dotnet project

## Run Instructions (linux/macos)

1) Run chmod +x build.sh to execute mode
2) Run ./build.sh to execute script
3) Add the 'go-module.so' file to the 'dotnet6-console' folder and set its properties build to None (it is the default) and to copy always (this is not have to be that way but only to simplify and to provide the POC for the use case)
